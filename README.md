# The Booking App

This Booking App was created as the final capstone project of the **Meta Front-End Developer Certification**.

**Preview**: Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant that blends traditional recipes with a modern twist. Our goal is to provide our customers with a unique dining experience that will take them on a culinary journey through the Mediterranean.

**Instructions Received**: To create a modern responsive Front-end for the Little Lemon app with a Bookings feature which they lack at present.

# Front-end Architecture

There were several considerations for the frontend architecture.

1. **Folder Structure** - How would the files be organized in the `src` folder.
2. **Component Architecture** - How best to write reusable components.
3. **Naming Conventions** - How and why CSS classes, CSS Variables are named so.
4. **Use of Dependencies** - Choice on what dependencies to use.
5. **Data Fetching** - How we will manage the data used by the app.
6. **Unit Testing** - How to have good coverage in our unit tests.
